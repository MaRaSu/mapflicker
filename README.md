# Instructions

Install as normal React Native project. Tested to work with XCode 13.

Use buttons in UI to test impact of marker & circle on Tile Overlay (URLTile).

- Works well until iOS 14.5
- Circle (marker with circle or circle alone) creates flickering on iOS 15 and in simulator also repeated toggling on / off also cause some map tiles to disappear! In real device with iOS15 only flickering is experienced, no disappearing map tiles (at least not with my iPhone).
